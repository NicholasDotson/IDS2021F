# PROBLEM 1

Aesthetics in data visualization are maps of data values into quantifiable features. Example include -

- Position
- Shape
- Size

# PROBLEM 2

The two major classes of aesthetics are continuous and non-continuous.

# PROBLEM 3

The two major types of data are quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative data is any data that is numerical such as age. Qualitative data is any data that is non-numericval (or categorical) such as species.

# PROBLEM 4

A common name for variables holding qualitative data is factors

# PROBLEM 5

Data that has an instrinsic order to it is called ordered data whereas data that does not have intrnsic order it called unordered. Examples of ordered and unordered data include -

- Ordered
  - Cold, Lukewarm, Hot
  - Child, Adult, Elder

- Unordered
  - Red, Blue, Green
  - Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry

# PROBLEM 6

Axes that should be represented with the same units and grid size are those where the data being compared is of the same type. Example can include -

- Temperature between regions
- Prices between regions

# PROBLEM 7

When comparing income between regions, it would be beneficial to view the axes in millions or billions of dollar due to regions having drastic differences in income due to resource differences.

# PROBLEM 8

Data that could be visualized with polar coordinates are those that are periodic in nature, like temperatures.

# PROBLEM 9

Four color scales are as follows:

- Qualitative color scales
   
 - A means to distinguish discrtete items or groups that do not have an intrisic order
 
- Sequential color scales

  - A means to distinguish the progression of an order

- Diverging color scales

  - A means to distinguish the deviation of data from a neutral point

- Accent color scale

  - A means to highlight data we deem important to show

# PROBLEM 10

The problem with the visualization is that the jump in value on the x-axis is too large.

# PROBLEM 11

- The x-axis is an increaing linear axis with markings every 5 integers. The y-axis is an exponential axis increasing by the power of 1 every marker.
- The mathematical function that would best describe the initial phases is y = x^n while the second phase would be y = log(x)

# PROBLEM 12

The first palette is better to visualize as there is a connotation of red meaning bad and green meaning good.

# PROBLEM 13
