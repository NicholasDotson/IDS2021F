# PROBLEM 1

  ENIAC stands for Electronic Numberical Integrator And Computer
  
# PROBLEM 2

  Everything is represented by integers in computers due to the simplicity. 0 and 1 are used to represent the flow of electrical current through a computer. The CPU reads this input and produces an output using an algorithim. Therefore, any integer that can be represented as a binary nubmer can be stored in computer's memory using it.
  
# PROBLEM 3

  The fastest part of the computer memory is the register.
  
# PROBLEM 4

  The slowerst part of hte computer memory is the disk.
  
# PROBLEM 5

  The smalles unit of information in computers is the bit.
  
# PROBLEM 6

- PART A

  - The closest programming language to machine/binary code is assembly code.

- PART B

  - Assembly code needs interpretation to become machine-comprehensible.

# PROBLEM 7

- PART A

  - The oldest high-level programing language is Fortran.

- PART B

  - Fortran was created in the 1950s.

# PROBLEM 8

- PART A

  - Assembley is a second-generation programming language

- PART B
