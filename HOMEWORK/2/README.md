# PROBLEM 1

 ENIAC stands for Electronic Numberical Integrator And Computer
  
# PROBLEM 2

Everything is represented by integers in computers due to the simplicity. 0 and 1 are used to represent the flow of electrical current through a computer. The CPU reads this input and produces an output using an algorithim. Therefore, any integer that can be represented as a binary nubmer can be stored in computer's memory using it.
  
# PROBLEM 3

The fastest part of the computer memory is the register.
  
# PROBLEM 4

The slowerst part of hte computer memory is the disk.
  
# PROBLEM 5

The smallest unit of information in computers is the bit.
  
# PROBLEM 6

- PART A

  - The closest programming language to machine/binary code is assembly code.

- PART B

  - Assembly code needs interpretation to become machine-comprehensible.

# PROBLEM 7

- PART A

  - The oldest high-level programing language is Fortran.

- PART B

  - Fortran was created in the 1950s.

# PROBLEM 8

- PART A

  - Assembley is a second-generation programming language

- PART B

 - GENERATION 3
    
   - FORTRAN
   - C
   - C++

  - GENERATION 4
  
   - MATLAB
   - PYTHON
   - R

# PROBLEM 9

- Created in the 1970's
  - C 
  - MATLAB
- Created in the 1980's
  - C++
- Created in the 1990's
  - Python

# PROBLEM 10

  An ancestor of C is B

# PROBLEM 11

An ancestor of C++ is C with Classes

# PROBLEM 12
  
A programming language ancestor of MATLAB is Fortran

A programming language ancestor(s) of Python is ANSI C, Modula 3, and ABC

# PROBLEM 13

- Three common errors in computer programs are -

 - Runtime error

  - The computer does not have enough memory to complete the task of the program.
 
 - Semantic Error 
 
  - In Python, instead of printing "Hello, World", it prints "Hellow World"
 
 - Syntax Error
  
  - You mispell the command

# PROBLEM 14

A memory leak is a runtime error.
